# Distribution Network Hosting Capacity Analysis under the New Power System

## Overview

This repository presents an advanced framework for analyzing **Distribution Network Hosting Capacity (DNHC)** under the evolving new power system. As distributed generation (DG) continues to expand‚Äîparticularly from variable renewable energy sources‚Äîaccurately evaluating the hosting capacity of distribution networks becomes increasingly critical for reliable and efficient grid operation.

## Background

Traditional DNHC assessment methods often rely on deterministic and linear models, which are limited in handling uncertainties and incomplete grid parameter data. These limitations can lead to:

- **Overestimation or underestimation** of hosting capacity
- **Inefficient resource allocation**
- **Reduced reliability** in operational planning

## Proposed Solution

This project introduces a **robust and adaptive framework** for DNHC analysis that:

- Integrates **stochastic modeling techniques** to capture the uncertainty of renewable generation
- Employs an **iterative optimization approach** to refine incomplete or imprecise system parameters
- Enhances **accuracy and reliability** in capacity evaluation under real-world conditions

## Key Features

- üìà Improved prediction accuracy in high-uncertainty environments
- üîÅ Iterative refinement of network models using incomplete data
- ‚ö° Stochastic modeling of renewable generation variability
- üß† Suitable for modern decentralized and renewable-rich power systems

## Methodology

1. **Model Initialization**: Begin with available (possibly incomplete) distribution network data.
2. **Stochastic Analysis**: Use probabilistic modeling to represent renewable energy inputs.
3. **Iterative Parameter Correction**: Apply optimization techniques to refine system parameters.
4. **Hosting Capacity Evaluation**: Calculate the DNHC using the updated network model.
5. **Performance Comparison**: Validate results against traditional methods using real-world data.

## Results

Experimental simulations on real-world grid datasets demonstrate that the proposed method:

- Achieves significantly better accuracy in DNHC estimation
- Performs robustly in the presence of parameter uncertainty
- Supports more reliable decision-making for DG integration

## Applications

- Grid planning and expansion studies
- Renewable energy integration strategies
- Smart grid and new power system design
- Power distribution network optimization
